<h2>About Document Object Model </h2>
<p>
	When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. 
	<br>
	With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
	<br>
    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page<br>
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page<br>
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page<br>
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes<br>
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes<br>
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page<br>
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page<br><br>

    The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.<br>

	The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

	"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."<br><br>

	The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:<br>

    Core DOM - standard model for all document types
    XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
    HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents<br><br>

    The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:<br>

    The HTML elements as objects<br>
    The properties of all HTML elements<br>
    The methods to access all HTML elements<br>
    The events for all HTML elements<br>

	In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.<br><br>



	The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).<br>

	In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.<br>

	The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.<br>

	A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).<br>

	A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).<br><br>


	In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property.
	<br><br><br>
	document.getElementById(id) 	Find an element by element id
	document.getElementsByTagName(name) 	Find elements by tag name
	document.getElementsByClassName(name) 	Find elements by class name
	<br><br><br>



	

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
</script>

</body>
</html>
