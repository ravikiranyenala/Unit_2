<h2>About HTML Events </h2>
<p>
	HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

	When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.<br> <br>

	An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

	Here are some examples of HTML events:

    An HTML web page has finished loading
    An HTML input field was changed
    An HTML button was clicked

	Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

	JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

	HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

	With single quotes:<br>

	<element event='some JavaScript'>

	<element event="some JavaScript">
	<br><br>

<p id = "txtLen"></p>
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">Get Today's date</button>

<button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">click to get today's date</button>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Today's date is:";
var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
document.getElementById("txtLen").innerHTML = "A-Z length : "+ txt.length;
